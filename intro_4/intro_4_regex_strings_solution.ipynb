    "## Regular expression\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's remember some key points about regular expressions (regex) in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `re` module is used for working with regular expressions in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Basic pattern matching:\n",
    "   - `re.search(pattern, string)` searches for a pattern in a string\n",
    "   - `re.findall(pattern, string)` finds all occurrences of a pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Common regex patterns:\n",
    "   - `.` matches any single character\n",
    "   - `^` matches the start of a string\n",
    "   - `$` matches the end of a string\n",
    "   - `[a-e]` matches any single character in the range a to e\n",
    "   - `[^abc]` matches any character except a, b, or c\n",
    "   - `\\d` matches any digit\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Quantifiers:\n",
    "   - `*` matches 0 or more occurrences\n",
    "   - `+` matches 1 or more occurrences\n",
    "   - `?` matches 0 or 1 occurrence\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Groups and alternation:\n",
    "   - `(...)` creates a group\n",
    "   - `|` represents alternation (OR)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Useful regex functions:\n",
    "   - `re.sub(pattern, replacement, string)` for substituting patterns\n",
    "   - `re.split(pattern, string)` for splitting strings based on a pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Flags can be used to modify regex behavior, e.g., `re.I` for case-insensitive matching\n",
    "\n",
    "8. It's important to remember that string manipulation using regex can be computationally intensive.\n",

      "Then, as hewended his way by swamp and stream and awful woodland, to the farmhousewhere he happened to be quartered, every sound of nature, at thatwitching hour, fluttered his excited imagination,--the moan of thewhip-poor-will from the hillside, the boding cry of the tree toad, thatharbinger of storm, the dreary hooting of the screech owl, or thesudden rustling in the thicket of birds frightened from their roost\n",
      "Thefireflies, too, which sparkled most vividly in the darkest places, nowand then startled him, as one of uncommon brightness would stream acrosshis path\n",

      "Another of his sources of fearful pleasure was to pass long winterevenings with the old Dutch wives, as they sat spinning by the fire,with a row of apples roasting and spluttering along the hearth, andlisten to their marvellous tales of ghosts and goblins, and hauntedfields, and haunted brooks, and haunted bridges, and haunted houses,and particularly of the headless horseman, or Galloping Hessian of theHollow, as they sometimes called him\n",
      "He would delight them equally byhis anecdotes of witchcraft, and of the direful omens and portentoussights and sounds in the air, which prevailed in the earlier times ofConnecticut\n",

      "But if there was a pleasure in all this, while snugly cuddling inthe chimney corner of a chamber that was all of a ruddy glow from thecrackling wood fire, and where, of course, no spectre dared to showits face, it was dearly purchased by the terrors of his subsequent walkhomewards\n",
