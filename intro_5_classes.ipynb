    "## Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's remember some key points of classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Class Definition**\n",
    "- A class is a blueprint for creating objects\n",
    "- Objects have attributes (properties) and behaviors (methods)\n",
    "- Classes help organize code into logical sections\n",
    "\n",
    "**Class Creation Basics**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ClassName:\n",
    "    # class attributes\n",
    "    attribute1 = value1\n",
    "    attribute2 = value2\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # methods\n",
    "    def method1(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Features\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initialization**\n",
    "- The `__init__` method initializes class attributes\n",
    "- `self` parameter refers to the instance being created[2]\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def __init__(self, parameter1, parameter2):\n",
    "    self.attribute1 = parameter1\n",
    "    self.attribute2 = parameter2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inheritance**\n",
    "- Allows creating new classes based on existing ones\n",
    "- Child classes inherit attributes and methods from parent class\n",
    "- Enables code reuse and hierarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Encapsulation**\n",
    "- Bundles attributes and methods inside a class\n",
    "- Provides data hiding using private attributes (with `_` or `__` prefix)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Polymorphism**\n",
    "- Same method name can perform different operations in different classes\n",
    "- Enables flexibility and code reusability\n",
    "- Methods can be overridden in child classes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "**Class Structure**\n",
    "- Keep related attributes and methods together\n",
    "- Use meaningful names for classes, attributes, and methods\n",
    "- Implement proper encapsulation using private attributes when needed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method Implementation**\n",
    "- Always include `self` parameter in instance methods\n",
    "- Use clear and descriptive method names\n",
    "- Follow single responsibility principle\n"
