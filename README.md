# Intro-to-Python-Exercises

Welcome to the "Intro to Python Exercises" repository! This collection is designed for the 2024/2025 Introduction to Computer Programming (Python) course [154140] at the University of Trento.

## Overview

This repository contains a compilation of interactive Python exercises aimed at helping students grasp fundamental programming concepts. The exercises are structured to complement the course lectures and provide hands-on practice.

## Contents

- **iPython Notebooks**: These are the iPython notebooks available for now. Each notebook includes a series of exercises along with their solutions. After each class new notebooks will be added.:
  - [`intro_1.ipynb`](intro_1.ipynb): Covers basic Python syntax, data types, and control structures.
    - [solutions 1]((intro_1_solutions.ipynb))
  - [`intro_2_function.ipynb`](intro_2_functions.ipynb): Focuses on functions.
    - [solutions 2](intro_2_functions_solutions.ipynb)
  - [`intro_3_io_regex.ipynb`](intro_3/intro_3_io_regex.ipynb): Focuses on I/O operations and regular expression use cases.
    - [solutions 3](intro_3/intro_3_io_regex_solution.ipynb) ## its partial for now
  - [`intro_4_regex_strings.ipynb`](intro_4/intro_4_regex_strings.ipynb): Focuses on regular expression use cases.
    - [solutions 4](intro_4/intro_4_regex_strings_solution.ipynb) ## not yet
